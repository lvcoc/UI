Due to possible compatibility issues between Unity versions, the unity standard assets are not included.

To make the coffee mug scene working import these standard assets:
	Characters
	Effects

Then open the scene and drag in the hierarchy a FPS Controller and a blur effect to the FPS camera

Now add the script Interactor and assing the public variables
	NOTE: Menu is Circle selector

Now you just need to open the interactor script and uncomment the comments
